The Dungeonâ€™s Curse (Core Gameplay & Progression)

The dungeon is alive, its structure warping as the player progresses. Choices affect not just the story, but the dungeon itself.

    Sanity & Corruption: The deeper you go, the more the abyss taints you. Lose too much sanity, and the dungeon starts whispering through your own voice.
    Branching Paths: Rooms, encounters, and puzzles evolve based on prior choices.
    Persistent Threats: Monsters learn from your actions, and something hunts you in the dark.
